# petition

This repository contains my 2nd project which I developed at SPICED-ACADEMY.
Stack: Express | Express-Handlebars | Node | PostgreSQL

It's a petition page which is developed as a single page application. The frontend is developed in React.js and the backend in Node.js. At the beginning of this project we got introduced to class components therefore some of the used React components are still class components.

The user can register or, if already done, login to the petition page and add optional personal information like age, url and city. Afterwards the user is able to leave his/her signature to sign the petition. The user is only able to see who else signed the petition after he/her signed the petition himself/herself. Furthermore the user is able to delete the own signature and account. All user data is stored in a PostgeSQL data base.
